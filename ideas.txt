Random event - it is really an aquarium, which the cat is watching -> a cat paw vertically into the tank and takes (kills) fish on its way

BETTER VISUALISATION:
A. text is displayed on fish - its size and hunger (always/after hovering with mouse)
B. base - all fish are green; when they get hungrier they slowly turn yellow and then red; when hunger reaches certain level and fish starts preying -> turns black.

DECOR
- When real fish pictures will be implemented -> dead fish changes into sceleton and falls to the bottom of screen; disappears after time
- Sand and moving (:o :3 <333 !!!) alga at the bottom of screen
