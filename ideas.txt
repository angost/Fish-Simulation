FUNCTIONAL
- different subclasses of Fish with different sizes, colors, pictures, swimming behaviour    ✓
    ex. fish which swims in circles (robi osemki); fish which sometimes kills without being hungry; fish which moves very slowly, only withing small area; fish which only swims deep in the sea -> in general, different habitat depths
- new fish being born (small eggs emerge from mother fish, after a while become normal adult fish) / emerging from out of the screen

BETTER VISUALISATION:
A. text is displayed on fish - its size and hunger (always/after hovering with mouse)
B. base - all fish are green; when they get hungrier they slowly turn yellow and then red; when hunger reaches certain level and fish starts preying -> turns black.    ✓

DECOR
- When real fish pictures will be implemented -> dead fish changes into sceleton and slowly falls to the bottom of screen; disappears after time    ✓
- Sand and moving (:o :3 <333 !!!) alga at the bottom of screen

EXTRAS
Random event - it is really an aquarium, which the cat is watching -> a cat paw vertically into the tank and takes (kills) fish on its way
